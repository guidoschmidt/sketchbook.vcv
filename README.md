1. To install VCV Rack Brige VST plugin, download [0.6.2c via
vcvrack.com/downloads/](https://vcvrack.com/downloads/).
2. :warning: DO NOT INSTALL the 0.6.2c VCV Rack Version, only install the *outdated* VST
   plugins to your System. The plugin still works with the current (1.1.6)
   version of VCV.
